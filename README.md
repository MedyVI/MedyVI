# From Culinary Precision to Web Development

Hi, I'm **Médy**, a **Web Developer** and founder of **Opus Tela**.

After several years in the culinary industry, I transitioned into web development, carrying over a strong mindset of **discipline, precision, organization, and execution**.  
Today, I design and build **modern, reliable, and maintainable web applications**, with a strong focus on **clean architecture and long-term scalability**.
