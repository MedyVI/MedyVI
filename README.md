# 👨‍🍳 From Chef to Web Developer

Hi, I'm **Médy**! After spending years honing my craft in the kitchen, I decided to pivot to web development to merge my creativity, precision, and problem-solving skills with technology. I'm passionate about building user-friendly, efficient web applications.

## 🚀 My Journey

- **Culinary Experience**: A chef’s mindset sharpened by years of attention to detail, creativity, and teamwork.
- **Web Development**: Transitioning to web development, I focus on both frontend and backend technologies, constantly striving to learn and grow in the field.

## 🌐 Skills & Technologies

### Frontend Development:
- **HTML** | **CSS** | **JavaScript**

### Backend Development:
- **PHP** | **Node.js** | **SQL** | **NoSQL** (MongoDB, MySQL)

### Tools & Frameworks:
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Package Managers**: npm
- **Backend Frameworks**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB

## 📚 What I'm Learning

I’m continuously learning and improving my skill set. Currently, I’m focused on:
- **React**: For building dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
- **Vue.js**: Exploring for frontend applications.
- **Laravel**: Learning backend development with PHP and building more complex systems.
- **SQL & NoSQL**: Enhancing my understanding of databases and how to use them effectively.

## 🔮 Technologies I Plan to Learn

In addition to the skills I'm currently developing, I also plan to dive into the following technologies in the near future:

- **Other Tools**: I'll also be exploring additional tools and frameworks as I grow in my career, such as **GraphQL**, **TypeScript**, and **WebAssembly**.

## 🎯 My Goals

- **Short-term**: Build and deploy dynamic applications using **React**, **Vue.js**, and **Laravel**.
- **Long-term**: Become proficient in full-stack development and contribute to meaningful open-source projects.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate!

- I'm eager to collaborate on **open-source projects** to enhance my skills and contribute to the community.
- Looking for **mentorship** and opportunities to grow within a team or development community.

## 💡 Why Web Development?
